## Live Demo

## API

API needs to be documented. 

## Things to improve

- Add *clear input* button
- Add keyboard support for search suggestions
- Toggle locations button
- More user-friendly destinations form validation
- For apps this size it's OK to use components props for passing data over app, but when scaling:
    - use **Context** to store globally used data
    - use **Redux** for even more complex app
- Tests required
