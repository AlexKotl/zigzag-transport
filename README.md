# dotscene

Small app that allows to plan a trip and shows CO2 emission of journey.

**React** + **TypeScript** + **Styled Components** + **apisouce**

## API

API needs to be documented. 

## Things to improve

- Add *clear input* 
- Add keyboard support for search suggestions
- Toggle locations button
- More user-friendly destinations form validation
- For apps this size it's OK to use components props for passing data over app, but when scaling:
    - use **Context** to store globally used data
    - use **Redux** for even more complex app
- Implement skeleton loading placeholders
- Tests required
